#+TITLE: acme-mode: Acme-inspired mouse control minor mode for Emacs

Note: I'm using a laptop without a mouse right now, so I'm not sure how well it works. May report back when I have a mouse to use. Caveat emptor.

* Functions to bind
** Acme Standard
- [X] Kill
- [X] Copy
- [X] Paste
- [X] Eval
- [X] Open (find-file or similar)

** Extras
- [X] Autofmt region (C-M-\)
- [X] Save

* Binds
- C-m1: copy
- C-m2: kill
- C-m3: search (like acme)
- C-S-m1: parenthesize
- C-S-m2: shell command (for now, until I think of something more useful)
- C-S-m3: search backward (like acme)
- M-m1: compile-file
- M-m2: open (whatever is in the region or the point is on)
- M-m3: save
- C-M-m1: Autofmt region
- C-M-m2: Comment region
- C-M-m3: Eval region (I could make this dwim-eval-region based on inferior lisp process. Hmmm)
- m4: previous buffer
- m5: next buffer

** Rationalization
+ = pre-bound
*** Base Level (raw click)
- M1: go to point +
- M2: paste/yank + 
- M3: select region from point +
- M4: previous buffer
- M5: next buffer
*** Main Actions (C-click) [i.e., actions that work directly on the text]
- M1: copy
- M2: kill
- M3: search word forward
- M4: ibuffer (for now)
- M5: ibuffer (for now)
*** Extended Main Actions (C-S-click)
- M1: parenthesize
- M2: shell command on region
- M3: search word backward
- M4: n/a
- M5: n/a
*** Meta Actions (M-click) [i.e., actions that work on the buffer or syntax tree, rather than text directly]
- M1: compile file
- M2: find file at point
- M3: save
- M4: undo (back button)
- M5: vc next action (forward button)
*** Extended Meta Actions (C-M-click)
- M1: indent region
- M2: comment region
- M3: eval region
- M4: n/a
- M5: n/a

* Notes
Can't directly do mouse chords (after some experimentation), so it's mouse+keyboard a go-go

C-scroll for zooming in/out is already implemented

m2 (middle mouse) is already yank/paste, so no problem there

m3 does clicky-click region selection

Double-clicking already selects sexp/line/etc

* Ideas
Leveraging the scroll wheel (C-S-wheel, M-wheel, etc)
